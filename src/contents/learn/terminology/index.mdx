## Terms

### Total
Related to the amount of goals scored in a game.
Two options: Over or Under
1. Over: To bet on the amount of goals to be over a threshold
2. Under: To bet on the amount of goals to be under a threshold
```
The 2022 World Cup final had a "Total" of approx. 2.5. Person A places a bet on the Over,
meaning they predict that the total number of goals (**not** including penalties) will be
over 2.5. Because partial goals do not exist in Soccer, that means the total number of goals
must be 3 or greater. The actual final score was 3 - 3, with Argentina winning the penalty
shoot-out 4-to-2. Thus the "Total" score of the game was 3 + 3 = 6, thus Person A would win
their bet.

In the event that the "Total" is an amount that can be exactly reached in the game, then
the bet is considered void or a "Push". This means that all betters would receive their
original bets back. In our example, if the "Total" had been 6, then Person A would receive
their original bet back, as the goals scored in the penatly shootout do not count toward
the "Total".

Calculation of the profits is explained in the "Payouts" sections.

### Spread
Related to the *performance* of a team, relative to their perception as the "underdogs" or
"favorites" leading into the match. Performance in this case, refers to the margin-of-victory,
or goal differential, of the winning team.
Two options: 
1. (+) Favorites "cover the spread"
2. (-) Favorites fail to "cover the spread"
The "Spread" is represented as a number, such as 0.25 or 1, and represents the difference
between number of goals by the favorites and underdogs (**not** including penalties).
```
The 2022 World Cup final had a "Spread" of approx. 0.25, with France (FRA) considered the favorites
and Argentina (ARG) the underdogs. Persona A placed a bet on the +0.25 spread, meaning they predict
that FRA will score 0.25 more goals than ARG. Partial goals don't exist in Soccer, so FRA would need
to score 1 or more goals in order to "cover the spread". The final score was 3 - 3, thus the
margin-of-victory or goal differential was 0. As FRA failed to "cover the spread", person A would have
lost their bet and received nothing.

In the event that the "Spread" is an amount that can be exactly reached in the game, then
it would be considered a failure to "cover the spread". This is due to the fact that the 
goal differential be strictly greater than the "Spread", thus betting on the (-) "Spread" has
slightly more conditions of succeeding.

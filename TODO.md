The project is at a point where base functionality is more or less complete. 
Styling and polishing can definitely be improved and added, however I have decided 
to move onto a different project starting today, September 12, 2024.

Below are some quick notes on features, components, ideas, etc. for my future self to consider
on the off chance that I decide to come back and work on Simply Sports again:

    - Authentication and profiles
    - Theme (background colors, button colors, fonts, etc.)
